### Quick assessments

Below are some quick assessments of PECA networks I received from Duren,
using a simple likelihood ratio calculation introduced in
[Zhu and Stephens (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1101/160770).
The aim of these quick assessments is to confirms whether these networks
are informative in identifying disease-related tissues or cell types.
