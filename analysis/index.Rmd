This is my online notebook to document and share the full results
of whole-genome integrated analyses of 38 gene regulatory networks
and 18 human complex traits described in the following research article:

> Xiang Zhu, Zhana Duren, Wing Hung Wong (2020).
> Modeling regulatory network topology improves genome-wide analyses of complex human traits.
> *bioRxiv*. <https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990010>.

If you find the analysis results, the pre-processed networks,
the statistical methods, and/or the open-source software useful for your work,
please kindly cite the research article listed above [(Zhu et al, 2020)][].
